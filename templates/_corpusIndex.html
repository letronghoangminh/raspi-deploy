        ).innerHTML = `plectranthus is a large genus of about 85 species of plants native to the tropical areas of the southern hemisphere plectranthus are in the same family as mint lamiaceae many have aromatic colorful foliage with leaf edges that tend to be wavy toothed or scalloped\n \n plectranthus are mainly annual and perennial shrubs and groundcover plants these plants are versatile most grow well inground in containers and as houseplants they are best planted in the spring or you can sow seeds indoors six weeks before the last frost\n \n as plectranthus is a fastgrowing lowmaintenance species some species are invasive like p amboinicus indian borage1 also some species are toxic to animals for example indian borage is also toxic to dogs cats and horses2\n \n common name\tspur flower\n botanical name\tplectranthus spp\n family\tlamiaceae\n plant type\tperennial annual groundcover shrub\n mature size\t6 in65 ft tall\n sun exposure\tfull partial\n soil type\twelldrained\n soil ph\tacidic\n bloom time\tspring winter fall\n flower color\tpurple pink white blue\n hardiness zones\t8 to 11 usda\n native area\tafrica asia\n toxicity\ttoxic to dogs cats and horses some species3\n plectranthus care\n generally plectranthus species are easy to grow and do not require much attention or special treatment they do best in locations that provide partial shade although some species can grow in full sun plectranthus are not frosttolerant but the perennial species will come back in the spring in warm winter locations\n \n they are shallowrooted plants appreciating adequate water but can tolerate short periods of drought since they store water in their stems they are easily propagated and only require pruning for cosmetic reasons\n warning\n some plectranthus species are considered invasive according to cabi formerly known as the center for agriculture and bioscience international p amboinicus indian borage is invasive in cuba and the pacific islands1 plectranthus ciliatus and p barbatus are two invasive species in south africa\n \n closeup of plectranthus\n  the spruce  kara riley\n closeup of plectranthus \n plectranthus \n closeup of flowers on plectranthus\n light\n the exact amount of light needed to grow plectranthus depends on the species very few can tolerate direct sun and may suffer from leaf burn if exposed to direct sun for too long4 however most plectranthus appreciate bright indirect light as a general rule of thumb when growing plectranthus outdoors choose a spot that receives sun for only part of the day or a shady spot beneath a tree when grown indoors you can put the plant in a location that receives direct light for most of the day\n \n soil\n one of the essential parts of growing plectranthus is ensuring they are planted in a welldraining potting medium standard potting soil mixed with perlite or sand should provide adequate drainage plectranthus do not tolerate wet feet which means their roots cannot sit in wet or soggy soil for prolonged periods\n \n water\n plectranthus require regular watering to thrive on average about 1 inch of water per week only water once the top inch or two of soil has dried out be careful not to overwater the soil should stay moist but not wet it is important to note that water needs may vary from species to species\n \n temperature and humidity\n while plectranthus is not a frosttolerant genus plants in this genus do well in colder temperatures and even flower during the shorter days of the year since the plectranthus genus comprises both annual and perennial species the exact temperature requirements vary from species to species\n \n plectranthus does not tolerate temperature extremes well most plectranthus cant handle cold temperatures for long periods but can take rare days that drop down to 10 degrees fahrenheit in sweltering climates plectranthus may struggle and require extra care watering and shade to survive\n \n plectranthus species prefer average to above average humidity from 50 percent up to 80 percent relative humidity\n \n fertilizer\n plectranthus plants appreciate monthly fertilization during their active growing period from the spring to the fall a standard 102010 plant fertilizer should be sufficient for most varieties for the amount to use follow product label instructions\n types of plectranthus\n among the bestknown plectranthus species is swedish ivy also called creeping charlie and a hybrid plectranthus called mona lavender a popular houseplant coleus is a common plant recently reclassified from the plectranthus genus to stand as its own genus\n \n plectranthus amboinicus mexican mint or indian borage\n plectranthus mona lavender\n plectranthus barbatus blue spur flower\n plectranthus verticillatus swedish ivy creeping charlie\n plectranthus amboinicus growing outside\n plectranthus amboinicus   ideation90  getty images\n pruning\n species in the plectranthus genus can be pruned regularly to help them maintain an attractive shape shrubby varieties look best when cut back and shaped into more dense bushes groundcover varieties grow quickly and may be pruned regularly to prevent overgrowing\n \n propagating plectranthus\n plectranthus are easily propagated through division and cuttings the best time to propagate is during the spring or early summer for example the blue spur flower is an aggressive spreader sending out offshoots under the soil you can dig up some of these offshoots and replant the divided plant with its intact roots into its new planter or patch of soil heres how to divide\n \n you will need welldraining soil a pot or planting location in partial light a hand trowel and optionally some pruning snips\n using the trowel cut down straight down in a circle around the plant section that you want to replant the plant section you take should be at least 2 to 3 inches smaller in circumference than the container the container should also have about 2 to 3 inches of fresh soil at the bottom\n pruning snips can come in handy helping you cut through straggling roots if necessary\n put the divided section into the pot or the hole in the ground and fill fresh soil around the plants roots water the plant\n another option for propagation is to use stem cuttings the cuttings root easily in soil and can be grown without much hassle heres how\n \n youll need sterile sharp garden snips or scissors welldraining soil and a pot or planting location in partial light cut a section from your plant at least 3 inches in length make sure the stem has at least five leaf nodes\n remove the bottom leaves leave the topmost two sets intact\n place your cutting cutend down in damp soil keep it moist while rooting it can take 2 to 3 weeks to root\n optionally to guarantee rooting place the cutting in a clear jar of filtered water while waiting for the roots to form replenish the filtered water every few days to keep the water line consistent after 2 to 3 weeks the roots should be an inch or twoâ€”long enough to replant plant the stem cutting and its new roots about an inch deep in the new pot or in the ground fill fresh soil around the plants roots water the plant\n how to grow plectranthus from seed\n you can start seeds 6 to 8 weeks indoors before the last frost in the spring youll need seed starting soil seed starting trays or small cups plant the seeds shallowly about 18 to 14 inch deep keep the soil moist and warm room temperature from 70 to 75 f provide bright light for at least 8 to 16 hours the plants need at least 8 hours of dark to grow seedlings should emerge in 7 to 14 days\n \n repot in about 6 to 8 weeks after the seedling emerges you can transplant in the ground as long as the last threat of frost is gone harden off or slowly acclimate the seedling to the temperature and sun conditions outdoors by setting out the plant for an hour each day increasing an hour each day over a week\n potting and repotting plectranthus\n plectranthus needs to drain adequately after watering select any container as long as it has ample drainage holes if transplanting as a seedling plant the seedling in a 4 to 6inch pot if repotting from a smaller pot make sure the new pot is at least 2 inches larger in diameter and has at least 2 inches of fresh soil at the bottom of the new container center the transplant in the pot and fill fresh soil around it water thoroughly until water drains out of the base\n \n overwintering\n in cold climates or snowy winters plectranthus will die back but may come back in the warmer spring months depending on the species some gardeners choose to move their plectranthus plants indoors for the cold winters which allows them to survive throughout the year\n \n before a plectranthus experiences dieback outdoors snip off a few succulent young stems with several leaves root the cuttings in filtered water on a windowsill remove the leaves that are below the waterline as the waterline recedes replenish the water every two weeks or so do a complete water change with fresh room temperature filtered water to stave off bacterial or fungal problems\n \n common pests  plant diseases\n pest problems rarely affect plectranthus however whiteflies aphids and red spider mites can sometimes strike during the summer months5 you can try organic treatments or environmentally less invasive remedies like insecticidal soap or neem oil to remove the infestations\n \n this plant is susceptible to fungal diseases like leaf spot stem rot and root rot3 leaf spot is often caused by leaves getting wet and staying that way poorly drained soils or containers with inadequate drainage are usually the main reason for root and stem rot its best to water plants in the morning and at the soil line and not directly on the foliage\n \n you can try a fungicide treatment and follow the package instructions to treat these fungal diseases also remove damaged leaves to prevent spores from spreading\n \n how to get plectranthus to bloom\n plectranthus plants flower multiple times a year flowering mainly at the end of the season during the years shortest days in winterhardy zones or in cool summer climates if you wonder why your plants are not blooming make sure your plants get no more than 12 hours of light since day length affects flowering pruning and deadheading faded flower spikes will likely encourage more blooms\n \n depending on the species the flowers can be purple pink white or blue most of the flowers do not have any scent but being a mint relative many plectranthus have aromatic leaves\n \n common problems with plectranthus\n plectranthus is not known for having many problems but sometimes it can attract a few pests and fungal issues its important to recognize signs that your plant is having some issues\n \n yellowing leaves\n if you notice lower leaves of a plant turning yellow falling off and wilting this may be a sign of root rot if watering doesnt perk up your plant you likely have root rot6 pull up the root ball and inspect the roots if most of the plants roots have blackened discard the plant using a sharp sterile knife cut away any blackened rotting roots and apply a fungicide you can only salvage the plant if it has healthy roots whitish yellowish light brown\n \n yellowing leaves can also occur if the plant gets too much sun sunburn can cause leaves to curl turn brown and dry up move the plant to a shadier spot to prevent leaves from getting scorched\n \n wilting leaves\n if your plant is wilting try giving more water if your plant does not recover when you water it its likely root rot6\n \n browning leaves\n plectranthus leaves can turn brown if the plant gets too much water or direct sun lacks nutrients or is attacked by pests a fungal infection can also cause leaf spots or rot bringing on browning leaves7 check the water light and fertilizer and inspect the leaves and stems for insect activity if necessary adjust any of those factors accordingly`
